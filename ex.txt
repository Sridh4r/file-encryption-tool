# 🔐 Secret Keeper 2.0 - Your Personal Encryption Wizard
# --------------------------------------------

# 🌟 Welcome!
This isn't just another encryption tool - it's your digital diary lock, 
your message-in-a-bottle, and your file vault all in one. We've taken the 
nerdy complexity out of encryption and made it simple enough for anyone to use.

# 🆕 What's Cooking in This Kitchen?
- Got files to hide? Now encrypt whole documents!
- Traveling abroad? We speak all languages (UTF-8)
- Accident-prone? We prevent oopsies with:
  - Key file protection
  - Overwrite warnings
  - Empty file checks

# 📦 What You're Getting
Your toolkit contains just two magical ingredients:
1. `main.py` - The wizard behind the curtain
2. `encryption_key.txt` - Your golden ticket (guard it like chocolate!)

# 🎩 How the Magic Works
Picture this: Every letter in your message gets a secret identity:
- 'A' becomes '🍕'
- 'B' becomes '🚀'
- '1' becomes '🎁'
...and so on for all 95 characters! Your key file is the only map to reverse 
this character witness protection program.

# 🚪 Getting Started is a Breeze
1. Open your command line and type:
   python3 main.py

2. Pick your potion from the menu:
   1 - Lock a secret message
   2 - Unlock a coded message
   3 - Seal a file shut
   4 - Crack open a sealed file
   5 - Change your magic password

3. Follow the friendly prompts - no spellbook required!

# ⚠️ Safety Dance
❗ Remember: Your `encryption_key.txt` is the ONE RING that rules them all.
Lose it, and your encrypted treasures are gone forever!

We've added training wheels:
- Key file is protected like grandma's china
- We'll double-check before overwriting files
- Empty files get a gentle warning

# 🧠 Wisdom from the Encryption Elders
1. Test drive your encryption immediately
2. Name encrypted files like "tax_secrets.encrypted"
3. Backup your key in 2 places (cloud + USB is ideal)
4. Change your key occasionally, like toothbrushes

# 🔧 Under the Hood (For Tech Wizards)
- Speaks UTF-8 like a native
- 95-character substitution cipher
- Error handling that actually helps
- Keys that remember themselves
