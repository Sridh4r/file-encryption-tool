# 🔐 Text Encryption Tool - README
# --------------------------------------------

# 📌 What is this?
# This is a fun and simple encryption tool built with Python.
# It replaces each character in your message with a unique one using a shuffled key.
# Think of it like a secret decoder ring, but cooler and more secure!

# 📁 Files Used:
# - encryption_key.txt : Stores your secret key for encryption/decryption.
# - main.py            : The main Python script where all the magic happens.

# ⚙️ How it Works:
# - The program checks for an existing encryption key.
# - If it finds one, it validates it.
# - If not, you'll be asked to either enter your own key or let the tool generate a new one.
# - Once the key is ready, you can start encrypting your messages.

# 🔑 About the Key:
# The key is made by shuffling these 95 characters:
# - All letters (A-Z, a-z)
# - Numbers (0-9)
# - Symbols (like !@#$%^&*)
# - And even the space character!
# It must have ALL 95, no repeats, no extras.


# ▶️ How to Run:
# 1. Make sure you have Python installed.
# 2. Open your terminal and run:
#    $ python3 main.py
# 3. Follow the instructions on screen.

# ❗ Notes:
# - Don’t use emojis or non-ASCII characters—they’re not supported.
# - Keep your key safe. You’ll need it to decrypt your messages later.
# - Same key = correct decryption. Wrong key = gibberish!
